# Tree Party!

I'm exploring data structures, so I built
some trees in JavaScript to understand making and
traversing a tree.

In this example, this is a trie. Words are added to the
tree using `makeTree` and passing in the root node;
use `getAllWords` to see the words currently in the tree,
and `findWord` to see if a word exists in the tree.
